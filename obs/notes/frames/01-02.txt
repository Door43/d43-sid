==== Translation Notes: ====

  * **God said**  - God created light by means of a simple verbal command.
  * **let there be**  - This is a command that happened immediately because it was spoken by God. It may be more natural to translate this as a statement of certainty that this would definitely happen. For example, you could translate this as, "God said, 'There will be light.'"
  * **light**  - This was a special light that God created–the sun was not created until later.
  * **was good**  - This phrase is often repeated through the Creation story, and emphasizes that each stage of creation was pleasing to God and accomplished his plan and purpose.
  * **creation**  - This word is used here to refer to the six-day period during which God made everything that exists.
