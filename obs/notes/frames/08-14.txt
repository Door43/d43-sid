  * **Even though Jacob was an old man, he moved to Egypt** - Egypt was a great distance away from Canaan, and it would have been difficult for an elderly man to walk or ride a cart that far.
  * **Before Jacob died** - Jacob died in Egypt. He did not get to return to Canaan, the land God had promised to give to him and his descendants.
